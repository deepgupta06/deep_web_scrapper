From Where to Begin?

Well, after reaching the above-mentioned step, you need to begin with the website_adminpanel.zip folder. Copy this folder as it is, and paste it in some other dedicated drive and folder and extract the files from the website_adminpanel.zip folder. The extracted files would appear as shown below

Now you just need to enter your website domain name/public/install in any browser, as shown below, and an installation wizard would automatically pop up on the screen.

http://yourdomain.com/install

To make the installation process smooth and user friendly, we have come up with a bit more innovative manner of installation where the user would be provided with an installation wizard, user would be required to keep putting the appropriate values in the relevant fields and the installation process would not take more than just a couple of minutes.

After uploading the source code, once we click it, this would open up by default an installation wizard that would look like this,

The above-given slide with Laravel Ecommerce App title is a welcome note to the user. By clicking on the Next button, the wizard would appear like this

The above mentioned are the dependencies or extensions for the server that are essential components for installation. All the green checks would ensure the presence of all the above mentioned dependencies. In case, if the system doesn’t have any of these dependencies already installed, a red cross mark would appear in the corresponding column of the missing component. So make sure to install all the dependencies and extensions to ensure the smooth running and installation of the app.

By clicking the next, the wizard would ask for the permissions as shown below.

You need to grant the directed permissions respectively for instance.

Storage/framework/                                                 775

App

Framework

Logs

Select the framework and logs folder, right-click on this, and now click on the change permission, enter the relevant vale 775, and click on the change permission on the bottom again.

In the same manner, grant permission to the bootstrap/cache folder by right-clicking on the folder and selecting change permission.

Once all the permissions are granted, all three folders would show a green checkmark on correspondent columns. From here click the next button.

In the next step, you need to complete the environment settings wizard.

4.2) – Android Studio Setting

There are three main things interacting when you use Android Studio to create android applications.

· The code you write in Java or Kotlin to create interactive android apps
· Android Studio itself, an IDE that provides you with a nice interface for coding
· Android SDK, a selection of tools including the Android platform itself

Now you can click on Android Studio to launch it. Once it opens up, you’ll be presented with a menu where you’ll be able to get started or configure some options. The great thing is that everything is handled for you at this point, though you may want to familiarize yourself with the SDK Manager (Configure > SDK Manager) which is where you’ll update your Android SDK to support newer versions, as well as download things like code samples or support for Google Glass. But don’t worry about that now but if Android Studio says you’re missing something, this is where you’ll probably need to go to find it.

4.3) – Open up Project in Android Studio

Locate your Android app in the given project .zip folder and extract it somewhere in your computer.

Once Android studio ready, click open an existing android studio project.

After every thing is done. your android studio project will look like this. you may ignore the plugin update if it recommends that.

Note: if you want to update your gradle plugin that may need to change some deep source code. It is better to user the same version of plugin.

Note: Your Android Version should be minimum 4.0.0. Updating Android Studio may take few minutes.

Source Code Setup #back to top

From Where to Begin?

Well, after reaching the above-mentioned step, you need to begin with the website_adminpanel.zip folder. Copy this folder as it is, and paste it in some other dedicated drive and folder and extract the files from the website_adminpanel.zip folder. The extracted files would appear as shown below

Now you just need to enter your website domain name/public/install in any browser, as shown below, and an installation wizard would automatically pop up on the screen.

http://yourdomain.com/install

To make the installation process smooth and user friendly, we have come up with a bit more innovative manner of installation where the user would be provided with an installation wizard, user would be required to keep putting the appropriate values in the relevant fields and the installation process would not take more than just a couple of minutes.

After uploading the source code, once we click it, this would open up by default an installation wizard that would look like this,

The above-given slide with Laravel Ecommerce App title is a welcome note to the user. By clicking on the Next button, the wizard would appear like this

The above mentioned are the dependencies or extensions for the server that are essential components for installation. All the green checks would ensure the presence of all the above mentioned dependencies. In case, if the system doesn’t have any of these dependencies already installed, a red cross mark would appear in the corresponding column of the missing component. So make sure to install all the dependencies and extensions to ensure the smooth running and installation of the app.

By clicking the next, the wizard would ask for the permissions as shown below.

You need to grant the directed permissions respectively for instance.

Storage/framework/                                                 775

Storage/logos/                                                             775

Bootstrap/cache/                                                        775

To grant these permissions>

Open your C panel, here you will find three folders in horizontal order named as

App

Framework

Logs

Select the framework and logs folder, right-click on this, and now click on the change permission, enter the relevant vale 775, and click on the change permission on the bottom again.

In the same manner, grant permission to the bootstrap/cache folder by right-clicking on the folder and selecting change permission.

Once all the permissions are granted, all three folders would show a green checkmark on correspondent columns. From here click the next button.

In the next step, you need to complete the environment settings wizard.

By clicking the Wizard Text Editor next slide will show up as given below

Step 1) Give any name to your Website as you like for instance, Laravel 1 or XYZ.

By clicking the true, all the errors would be shown

By clicking the false, no errors would be shown.

Step 4) In Log Type section select debug.

Step 5) In Website URL section, paste your app’s URL and click on the database on the bottom of the wizard.

In the next wizard section, you will be required to enter your database information.

Note: In any case, if you need to change your .env settings or need to change the production or any other mode, you can go to the link below and alter your settings as required. But first complete all the requirements of this wizard.

Download JDK
Download Android studio IDE

4.2) – Android Studio Setting

There are three main things interacting when you use Android Studio to create android applications.

· The code you write in Java or Kotlin to create interactive android apps
· Android Studio itself, an IDE that provides you with a nice interface for coding
· Android SDK, a selection of tools including the Android platform itself

Now you can click on Android Studio to launch it. Once it opens up, you’ll be presented with a menu where you’ll be able to get started or configure some options. The great thing is that everything is handled for you at this point, though you may want to familiarize yourself with the SDK Manager (Configure > SDK Manager) which is where you’ll update your Android SDK to support newer versions, as well as download things like code samples or support for Google Glass. But don’t worry about that now but if Android Studio says you’re missing something, this is where you’ll probably need to go to find it.

4.3) – Open up Project in Android Studio

Locate your Android app in the given project .zip folder and extract it somewhere in your computer.

Once Android studio ready, click open an existing android studio project.

Browse to directory where you placed the android project and click OK after selecting the root directory of project.

While importing your android app you may get some dependencies errors. to resolve that you just need to update versions of libraries or dependencies.

After every thing is done. your android studio project will look like this. you may ignore the plugin update if it recommends that.

Note: if you want to update your gradle plugin that may need to change some deep source code. It is better to user the same version of plugin.

Note: Your Android Version should be minimum 4.0.0. Updating Android Studio may take few minutes.

Project directory structure looks like this. your all java source code is placed under the following package.

we only need ConstantValues.java file to attach our backend.

Note:For Publishing use this command
keytool -exportcert -alias “aliasName” -keystore “keystoreFilePath” | openssl sha1 -binary | openssl base64M

Note: remember to change the path to you debug.keystore file. and make it sure to use the OpenSSL folder name same as you created in the C drive.

Import App into Android Studio #back to top

After CMS installation, please follow below given instructions to set up your mobile application..

4.1) – Getting Started

Download and install all latest tools, required for developing Android apps such as Java Development Kit and Android Studio as the Official Android IDE. For updated tutorial about how to install them, you can see and Download this from Android Developer website.
Download JDK
Download Android studio IDE

4.2) – Android Studio Setting

There are three main things interacting when you use Android Studio to create android applications.

· The code you write in Java or Kotlin to create interactive android apps
· Android Studio itself, an IDE that provides you with a nice interface for coding
· Android SDK, a selection of tools including the Android platform itself

Now you can click on Android Studio to launch it. Once it opens up, you’ll be presented with a menu where you’ll be able to get started or configure some options. The great thing is that everything is handled for you at this point, though you may want to familiarize yourself with the SDK Manager (Configure > SDK Manager) which is where you’ll update your Android SDK to support newer versions, as well as download things like code samples or support for Google Glass. But don’t worry about that now but if Android Studio says you’re missing something, this is where you’ll probably need to go to find it.

4.3) – Open up Project in Android Studio

Locate your Android app in the given project .zip folder and extract it somewhere in your computer.

Once Android studio ready, click open an existing android studio project.

Browse to directory where you placed the android project and click OK after selecting the root directory of project.

While opening up the project you will get a popup like this. please click OK to building the project.

After this android studio will download some of the packages and execute some gradle plugins into your project.

Note: This may take some time to compile.

While importing your android app you may get some dependencies errors. to resolve that you just need to update versions of libraries or dependencies.

After every thing is done. your android studio project will look like this. you may ignore the plugin update if it recommends that.

Note: if you want to update your gradle plugin that may need to change some deep source code. It is better to user the same version of plugin.

Note: Your Android Version should be minimum 4.0.0. Updating Android Studio may take few minutes.

Project directory structure looks like this. your all java source code is placed under the following package.

we only need ConstantValues.java file to attach our backend.

ConstantValues file looks like this.

Next you need to find the path of debug.keystore file in the C drive usually it is placed in the C:\Users\YOUR_NAME\.android folder.
Now open the Command Prompt. and execute the following command.

Note: For Debugging (use it for development purpose only.)
keytool -exportcert -alias androiddebugkey -keystore “C:\Users\YOUR_NAME\.android\debug.keystore” | “C:\OpenSSL\bin\openssl” sha1 -binary |”C:\OpenSSL\bin\openssl” base64


Note:For Publishing use this command
keytool -exportcert -alias “aliasName” -keystore “keystoreFilePath” | openssl sha1 -binary | openssl base64M

Note: remember to change the path to you debug.keystore file. and make it sure to use the OpenSSL folder name same as you created in the C drive.
when you press enter this will get a password. If you do not create a new password, then default password will be android

Key Hash For Mac

Please follow below mention steps to get hash key for mac OS

First open a terminal (open a command prompt in windows).

Navigate in the terminal to the directory where your Android debug.keystore is stored. Mostly it will located under /Users/user_name/.android/

Once you are in the “.android” directory, run the following command. keytool -exportcert -alias androiddebugkey -keystore debug.keystore | openssl sha1 -binary | openssl base64

When it prompts you for a password, type android and hit Enter

Copy the value printed in the terminal that ends with an = and paste it in the Key Hash field in Facebook. Then click the Save Changes button.

This is your key hash save it to your file and use it in developer Facebook console.
Now paste the application key to the android studio project file shown below as facebook_app_id. (res > values > strings.xml)

Now to get fb_login_protocol_scheme first go to your facebook app settings and in facebook login section select Quickstart and then select android

In the Edit Your Resource and Manifest section you can get fb_login_protocol_scheme. Just copy and save it.

Source Code Setup #back to top

From Where to Begin?

Well, after reaching the above-mentioned step, you need to begin with the website_adminpanel.zip folder. Copy this folder as it is, and paste it in some other dedicated drive and folder and extract the files from the website_adminpanel.zip folder. The extracted files would appear as shown below

Now you just need to enter your website domain name/public/install in any browser, as shown below, and an installation wizard would automatically pop up on the screen.

http://yourdomain.com/install

To make the installation process smooth and user friendly, we have come up with a bit more innovative manner of installation where the user would be provided with an installation wizard, user would be required to keep putting the appropriate values in the relevant fields and the installation process would not take more than just a couple of minutes.

After uploading the source code, once we click it, this would open up by default an installation wizard that would look like this,

The above-given slide with Laravel Ecommerce App title is a welcome note to the user. By clicking on the Next button, the wizard would appear like this

The above mentioned are the dependencies or extensions for the server that are essential components for installation. All the green checks would ensure the presence of all the above mentioned dependencies. In case, if the system doesn’t have any of these dependencies already installed, a red cross mark would appear in the corresponding column of the missing component. So make sure to install all the dependencies and extensions to ensure the smooth running and installation of the app.

By clicking the next, the wizard would ask for the permissions as shown below.

You need to grant the directed permissions respectively for instance.

Storage/framework/                                                 775

Storage/logos/                                                             775

Bootstrap/cache/                                                        775

To grant these permissions>

Open your C panel, here you will find three folders in horizontal order named as

App

Framework

Logs

Select the framework and logs folder, right-click on this, and now click on the change permission, enter the relevant vale 775, and click on the change permission on the bottom again.

In the same manner, grant permission to the bootstrap/cache folder by right-clicking on the folder and selecting change permission.

Once all the permissions are granted, all three folders would show a green checkmark on correspondent columns. From here click the next button.

In the next step, you need to complete the environment settings wizard.

By clicking the Wizard Text Editor next slide will show up as given below

Step 1) Give any name to your Website as you like for instance, Laravel 1 or XYZ.

Step 2) From development mode that carries the following option(s)

By clicking the true, all the errors would be shown

By clicking the false, no errors would be shown.

Step 4) In Log Type section select debug.

Step 5) In Website URL section, paste your app’s URL and click on the database on the bottom of the wizard.

In the next wizard section, you will be required to enter your database information.

Note: In any case, if you need to change your .env settings or need to change the production or any other mode, you can go to the link below and alter your settings as required. But first complete all the requirements of this wizard.

http://yourdomain/admin/setting

To begin with this, you need to create an empty database first in your PHPMyAdmin, enter all of the details of that empty database in the above wizard, and click on the application on the bottom of the wizard.

There are three main things interacting when you use Android Studio to create android applications.

· Android SDK, a selection of tools including the Android platform itself

Now you can click on Android Studio to launch it. Once it opens up, you’ll be presented with a menu where you’ll be able to get started or configure some options. The great thing is that everything is handled for you at this point, though you may want to familiarize yourself with the SDK Manager (Configure > SDK Manager) which is where you’ll update your Android SDK to support newer versions, as well as download things like code samples or support for Google Glass. But don’t worry about that now but if Android Studio says you’re missing something, this is where you’ll probably need to go to find it.

4.3) – Open up Project in Android Studio

From Where to Begin?

Well, after reaching the above-mentioned step, you need to begin with the website_adminpanel.zip folder. Copy this folder as it is, and paste it in some other dedicated drive and folder and extract the files from the website_adminpanel.zip folder. The extracted files would appear as shown below

http://yourdomain.com/install

To make the installation process smooth and user friendly, we have come up with a bit more innovative manner of installation where the user would be provided with an installation wizard, user would be required to keep putting the appropriate values in the relevant fields and the installation process would not take more than just a couple of minutes.

After uploading the source code, once we click it, this would open up by default an installation wizard that would look like this,

The above-given slide with Laravel Ecommerce App title is a welcome note to the user. By clicking on the Next button, the wizard would appear like this

The above mentioned are the dependencies or extensions for the server that are essential components for installation. All the green checks would ensure the presence of all the above mentioned dependencies. In case, if the system doesn’t have any of these dependencies already installed, a red cross mark would appear in the corresponding column of the missing component. So make sure to install all the dependencies and extensions to ensure the smooth running and installation of the app.

By clicking the next, the wizard would ask for the permissions as shown below.

Bootstrap/cache/                                                        775

To grant these permissions>

App

Framework

Logs

Import App into Android Studio #back to top

After CMS installation, please follow below given instructions to set up your mobile application..

4.1) – Getting Started

Download and install all latest tools, required for developing Android apps such as Java Development Kit and Android Studio as the Official Android IDE. For updated tutorial about how to install them, you can see and Download this from Android Developer website.
Download JDK
Download Android studio IDE

4.2) – Android Studio Setting

There are three main things interacting when you use Android Studio to create android applications.

· The code you write in Java or Kotlin to create interactive android apps
· Android Studio itself, an IDE that provides you with a nice interface for coding
· Android SDK, a selection of tools including the Android platform itself

Now you can click on Android Studio to launch it. Once it opens up, you’ll be presented with a menu where you’ll be able to get started or configure some options. The great thing is that everything is handled for you at this point, though you may want to familiarize yourself with the SDK Manager (Configure > SDK Manager) which is where you’ll update your Android SDK to support newer versions, as well as download things like code samples or support for Google Glass. But don’t worry about that now but if Android Studio says you’re missing something, this is where you’ll probably need to go to find it.

4.3) – Open up Project in Android Studio

Locate your Android app in the given project .zip folder and extract it somewhere in your computer.

Once Android studio ready, click open an existing android studio project.

Browse to directory where you placed the android project and click OK after selecting the root directory of project.

While opening up the project you will get a popup like this. please click OK to building the project.

After this android studio will download some of the packages and execute some gradle plugins into your project.

Note: This may take some time to compile.

While importing your android app you may get some dependencies errors. to resolve that you just need to update versions of libraries or dependencies.

After every thing is done. your android studio project will look like this. you may ignore the plugin update if it recommends that.

Note: if you want to update your gradle plugin that may need to change some deep source code. It is better to user the same version of plugin.

Note: Your Android Version should be minimum 4.0.0. Updating Android Studio may take few minutes.

Project directory structure looks like this. your all java source code is placed under the following package.

we only need ConstantValues.java file to attach our backend.

Now open the Command Prompt. and execute the following command.

Note: For Debugging (use it for development purpose only.)
keytool -exportcert -alias androiddebugkey -keystore “C:\Users\YOUR_NAME\.android\debug.keystore” | “C:\OpenSSL\bin\openssl” sha1 -binary |”C:\OpenSSL\bin\openssl” base64


Note:For Publishing use this command
keytool -exportcert -alias “aliasName” -keystore “keystoreFilePath” | openssl sha1 -binary | openssl base64M

Note: remember to change the path to you debug.keystore file. and make it sure to use the OpenSSL folder name same as you created in the C drive.
when you press enter this will get a password. If you do not create a new password, then default password will be android

Key Hash For Mac

When it prompts you for a password, type android and hit Enter

Copy the value printed in the terminal that ends with an = and paste it in the Key Hash field in Facebook. Then click the Save Changes button.

This is your key hash save it to your file and use it in developer Facebook console.

Source Code Setup #back to top

From Where to Begin?

Well, after reaching the above-mentioned step, you need to begin with the website_adminpanel.zip folder. Copy this folder as it is, and paste it in some other dedicated drive and folder and extract the files from the website_adminpanel.zip folder. The extracted files would appear as shown below

Now you just need to enter your website domain name/public/install in any browser, as shown below, and an installation wizard would automatically pop up on the screen.

http://yourdomain.com/install

To make the installation process smooth and user friendly, we have come up with a bit more innovative manner of installation where the user would be provided with an installation wizard, user would be required to keep putting the appropriate values in the relevant fields and the installation process would not take more than just a couple of minutes.

After uploading the source code, once we click it, this would open up by default an installation wizard that would look like this,

The above-given slide with Laravel Ecommerce App title is a welcome note to the user. By clicking on the Next button, the wizard would appear like this

The above mentioned are the dependencies or extensions for the server that are essential components for installation. All the green checks would ensure the presence of all the above mentioned dependencies. In case, if the system doesn’t have any of these dependencies already installed, a red cross mark would appear in the corresponding column of the missing component. So make sure to install all the dependencies and extensions to ensure the smooth running and installation of the app.

By clicking the next, the wizard would ask for the permissions as shown below.

You need to grant the directed permissions respectively for instance.

Storage/framework/                                                 775

Storage/logos/                                                             775

Bootstrap/cache/                                                        775

To grant these permissions>

Open your C panel, here you will find three folders in horizontal order named as

App

Framework

Logs

Select the framework and logs folder, right-click on this, and now click on the change permission, enter the relevant vale 775, and click on the change permission on the bottom again.

In the same manner, grant permission to the bootstrap/cache folder by right-clicking on the folder and selecting change permission.

Once all the permissions are granted, all three folders would show a green checkmark on correspondent columns. From here click the next button.

In the next step, you need to complete the environment settings wizard.

By clicking the Wizard Text Editor next slide will show up as given below

Step 1) Give any name to your Website as you like for instance, Laravel 1 or XYZ.

Step 2) From development mode that carries the following option(s)

By clicking the true, all the errors would be shown

By clicking the false, no errors would be shown.

Step 4) In Log Type section select debug.

Step 5) In Website URL section, paste your app’s URL and click on the database on the bottom of the wizard.

In the next wizard section, you will be required to enter your database information.

Note: In any case, if you need to change your .env settings or need to change the production or any other mode, you can go to the link below and alter your settings as required. But first complete all the requirements of this wizard.

http://yourdomain/admin/setting

To begin with this, you need to create an empty database first in your PHPMyAdmin, enter all of the details of that empty database in the above wizard, and click on the application on the bottom of the wizard.

4.2) – Android Studio Setting

There are three main things interacting when you use Android Studio to create android applications.

· The code you write in Java or Kotlin to create interactive android apps
· Android Studio itself, an IDE that provides you with a nice interface for coding
· Android SDK, a selection of tools including the Android platform itself

Now you can click on Android Studio to launch it. Once it opens up, you’ll be presented with a menu where you’ll be able to get started or configure some options. The great thing is that everything is handled for you at this point, though you may want to familiarize yourself with the SDK Manager (Configure > SDK Manager) which is where you’ll update your Android SDK to support newer versions, as well as download things like code samples or support for Google Glass. But don’t worry about that now but if Android Studio says you’re missing something, this is where you’ll probably need to go to find it.

4.3) – Open up Project in Android Studio

Locate your Android app in the given project .zip folder and extract it somewhere in your computer.

After every thing is done. your android studio project will look like this. you may ignore the plugin update if it recommends that.

Note: if you want to update your gradle plugin that may need to change some deep source code. It is better to user the same version of plugin.

From Where to Begin?

Well, after reaching the above-mentioned step, you need to begin with the website_adminpanel.zip folder. Copy this folder as it is, and paste it in some other dedicated drive and folder and extract the files from the website_adminpanel.zip folder. The extracted files would appear as shown below

Now you just need to enter your website domain name/public/install in any browser, as shown below, and an installation wizard would automatically pop up on the screen.

http://yourdomain.com/install

To make the installation process smooth and user friendly, we have come up with a bit more innovative manner of installation where the user would be provided with an installation wizard, user would be required to keep putting the appropriate values in the relevant fields and the installation process would not take more than just a couple of minutes.

After uploading the source code, once we click it, this would open up by default an installation wizard that would look like this,

The above-given slide with Laravel Ecommerce App title is a welcome note to the user. By clicking on the Next button, the wizard would appear like this

The above mentioned are the dependencies or extensions for the server that are essential components for installation. All the green checks would ensure the presence of all the above mentioned dependencies. In case, if the system doesn’t have any of these dependencies already installed, a red cross mark would appear in the corresponding column of the missing component. So make sure to install all the dependencies and extensions to ensure the smooth running and installation of the app.

By clicking the next, the wizard would ask for the permissions as shown below.

You need to grant the directed permissions respectively for instance.

Bootstrap/cache/                                                        775

To grant these permissions>

Open your C panel, here you will find three folders in horizontal order named as

App

Framework

Logs

Select the framework and logs folder, right-click on this, and now click on the change permission, enter the relevant vale 775, and click on the change permission on the bottom again.

In the same manner, grant permission to the bootstrap/cache folder by right-clicking on the folder and selecting change permission.

Once all the permissions are granted, all three folders would show a green checkmark on correspondent columns. From here click the next button.

There are three main things interacting when you use Android Studio to create android applications.

Source Code Setup #back to top

From Where to Begin?

Well, after reaching the above-mentioned step, you need to begin with the website_adminpanel.zip folder. Copy this folder as it is, and paste it in some other dedicated drive and folder and extract the files from the website_adminpanel.zip folder. The extracted files would appear as shown below

Now you just need to enter your website domain name/public/install in any browser, as shown below, and an installation wizard would automatically pop up on the screen.

http://yourdomain.com/install

To make the installation process smooth and user friendly, we have come up with a bit more innovative manner of installation where the user would be provided with an installation wizard, user would be required to keep putting the appropriate values in the relevant fields and the installation process would not take more than just a couple of minutes.

After uploading the source code, once we click it, this would open up by default an installation wizard that would look like this,

The above-given slide with Laravel Ecommerce App title is a welcome note to the user. By clicking on the Next button, the wizard would appear like this

The above mentioned are the dependencies or extensions for the server that are essential components for installation. All the green checks would ensure the presence of all the above mentioned dependencies. In case, if the system doesn’t have any of these dependencies already installed, a red cross mark would appear in the corresponding column of the missing component. So make sure to install all the dependencies and extensions to ensure the smooth running and installation of the app.

By clicking the next, the wizard would ask for the permissions as shown below.

You need to grant the directed permissions respectively for instance.

Storage/framework/                                                 775

Storage/logos/                                                             775

Bootstrap/cache/                                                        775

To grant these permissions>

Open your C panel, here you will find three folders in horizontal order named as

App

Framework

Logs

Select the framework and logs folder, right-click on this, and now click on the change permission, enter the relevant vale 775, and click on the change permission on the bottom again.

In the same manner, grant permission to the bootstrap/cache folder by right-clicking on the folder and selecting change permission.

Once all the permissions are granted, all three folders would show a green checkmark on correspondent columns. From here click the next button.

In the next step, you need to complete the environment settings wizard.

By clicking the Wizard Text Editor next slide will show up as given below

Step 1) Give any name to your Website as you like for instance, Laravel 1 or XYZ.

By clicking the false, no errors would be shown.

Step 4) In Log Type section select debug.

Step 5) In Website URL section, paste your app’s URL and click on the database on the bottom of the wizard.

In the next wizard section, you will be required to enter your database information.

Note: In any case, if you need to change your .env settings or need to change the production or any other mode, you can go to the link below and alter your settings as required. But first complete all the requirements of this wizard.

4.2) – Android Studio Setting

There are three main things interacting when you use Android Studio to create android applications.

· The code you write in Java or Kotlin to create interactive android apps
· Android Studio itself, an IDE that provides you with a nice interface for coding
· Android SDK, a selection of tools including the Android platform itself

Now you can click on Android Studio to launch it. Once it opens up, you’ll be presented with a menu where you’ll be able to get started or configure some options. The great thing is that everything is handled for you at this point, though you may want to familiarize yourself with the SDK Manager (Configure > SDK Manager) which is where you’ll update your Android SDK to support newer versions, as well as download things like code samples or support for Google Glass. But don’t worry about that now but if Android Studio says you’re missing something, this is where you’ll probably need to go to find it.

4.3) – Open up Project in Android Studio

Locate your Android app in the given project .zip folder and extract it somewhere in your computer.

Once Android studio ready, click open an existing android studio project.

Source Code Setup #back to top

From Where to Begin?

Well, after reaching the above-mentioned step, you need to begin with the website_adminpanel.zip folder. Copy this folder as it is, and paste it in some other dedicated drive and folder and extract the files from the website_adminpanel.zip folder. The extracted files would appear as shown below

Now you just need to enter your website domain name/public/install in any browser, as shown below, and an installation wizard would automatically pop up on the screen.

http://yourdomain.com/install

To make the installation process smooth and user friendly, we have come up with a bit more innovative manner of installation where the user would be provided with an installation wizard, user would be required to keep putting the appropriate values in the relevant fields and the installation process would not take more than just a couple of minutes.

After uploading the source code, once we click it, this would open up by default an installation wizard that would look like this,

The above-given slide with Laravel Ecommerce App title is a welcome note to the user. By clicking on the Next button, the wizard would appear like this

The above mentioned are the dependencies or extensions for the server that are essential components for installation. All the green checks would ensure the presence of all the above mentioned dependencies. In case, if the system doesn’t have any of these dependencies already installed, a red cross mark would appear in the corresponding column of the missing component. So make sure to install all the dependencies and extensions to ensure the smooth running and installation of the app.

By clicking the next, the wizard would ask for the permissions as shown below.

You need to grant the directed permissions respectively for instance.

Storage/framework/                                                 775

Storage/logos/                                                             775

Bootstrap/cache/                                                        775

To grant these permissions>

Open your C panel, here you will find three folders in horizontal order named as

App

Framework

Logs

Select the framework and logs folder, right-click on this, and now click on the change permission, enter the relevant vale 775, and click on the change permission on the bottom again.

In the same manner, grant permission to the bootstrap/cache folder by right-clicking on the folder and selecting change permission.

Once all the permissions are granted, all three folders would show a green checkmark on correspondent columns. From here click the next button.

In the next step, you need to complete the environment settings wizard.

By clicking the false, no errors would be shown.

Step 4) In Log Type section select debug.

Step 5) In Website URL section, paste your app’s URL and click on the database on the bottom of the wizard.

In the next wizard section, you will be required to enter your database information.

Note: In any case, if you need to change your .env settings or need to change the production or any other mode, you can go to the link below and alter your settings as required. But first complete all the requirements of this wizard.

There are three main things interacting when you use Android Studio to create android applications.

· Android SDK, a selection of tools including the Android platform itself

Now you can click on Android Studio to launch it. Once it opens up, you’ll be presented with a menu where you’ll be able to get started or configure some options. The great thing is that everything is handled for you at this point, though you may want to familiarize yourself with the SDK Manager (Configure > SDK Manager) which is where you’ll update your Android SDK to support newer versions, as well as download things like code samples or support for Google Glass. But don’t worry about that now but if Android Studio says you’re missing something, this is where you’ll probably need to go to find it.

Note: if you want to update your gradle plugin that may need to change some deep source code. It is better to user the same version of plugin.

Note: Your Android Version should be minimum 4.0.0. Updating Android Studio may take few minutes.

From Where to Begin?

Well, after reaching the above-mentioned step, you need to begin with the website_adminpanel.zip folder. Copy this folder as it is, and paste it in some other dedicated drive and folder and extract the files from the website_adminpanel.zip folder. The extracted files would appear as shown below

Now you just need to enter your website domain name/public/install in any browser, as shown below, and an installation wizard would automatically pop up on the screen.

http://yourdomain.com/install

To make the installation process smooth and user friendly, we have come up with a bit more innovative manner of installation where the user would be provided with an installation wizard, user would be required to keep putting the appropriate values in the relevant fields and the installation process would not take more than just a couple of minutes.

After uploading the source code, once we click it, this would open up by default an installation wizard that would look like this,

The above-given slide with Laravel Ecommerce App title is a welcome note to the user. By clicking on the Next button, the wizard would appear like this

The above mentioned are the dependencies or extensions for the server that are essential components for installation. All the green checks would ensure the presence of all the above mentioned dependencies. In case, if the system doesn’t have any of these dependencies already installed, a red cross mark would appear in the corresponding column of the missing component. So make sure to install all the dependencies and extensions to ensure the smooth running and installation of the app.

By clicking the next, the wizard would ask for the permissions as shown below.

You need to grant the directed permissions respectively for instance.

Storage/framework/                                                 775

Bootstrap/cache/                                                        775

To grant these permissions>

App

Framework

Logs

Select the framework and logs folder, right-click on this, and now click on the change permission, enter the relevant vale 775, and click on the change permission on the bottom again.

In the same manner, grant permission to the bootstrap/cache folder by right-clicking on the folder and selecting change permission.

Once all the permissions are granted, all three folders would show a green checkmark on correspondent columns. From here click the next button.

In the next step, you need to complete the environment settings wizard.

By clicking the Wizard Text Editor next slide will show up as given below

Step 1) Give any name to your Website as you like for instance, Laravel 1 or XYZ.

By clicking the false, no errors would be shown.

Step 4) In Log Type section select debug.

Step 5) In Website URL section, paste your app’s URL and click on the database on the bottom of the wizard.

In the next wizard section, you will be required to enter your database information.

Download JDK
Download Android studio IDE

4.2) – Android Studio Setting

There are three main things interacting when you use Android Studio to create android applications.

· The code you write in Java or Kotlin to create interactive android apps
· Android Studio itself, an IDE that provides you with a nice interface for coding
· Android SDK, a selection of tools including the Android platform itself

Now you can click on Android Studio to launch it. Once it opens up, you’ll be presented with a menu where you’ll be able to get started or configure some options. The great thing is that everything is handled for you at this point, though you may want to familiarize yourself with the SDK Manager (Configure > SDK Manager) which is where you’ll update your Android SDK to support newer versions, as well as download things like code samples or support for Google Glass. But don’t worry about that now but if Android Studio says you’re missing something, this is where you’ll probably need to go to find it.

4.3) – Open up Project in Android Studio

Locate your Android app in the given project .zip folder and extract it somewhere in your computer.

Once Android studio ready, click open an existing android studio project.

Browse to directory where you placed the android project and click OK after selecting the root directory of project.

While importing your android app you may get some dependencies errors. to resolve that you just need to update versions of libraries or dependencies.

After every thing is done. your android studio project will look like this. you may ignore the plugin update if it recommends that.

Note: if you want to update your gradle plugin that may need to change some deep source code. It is better to user the same version of plugin.

Note: Your Android Version should be minimum 4.0.0. Updating Android Studio may take few minutes.

Source Code Setup #back to top

From Where to Begin?

Well, after reaching the above-mentioned step, you need to begin with the website_adminpanel.zip folder. Copy this folder as it is, and paste it in some other dedicated drive and folder and extract the files from the website_adminpanel.zip folder. The extracted files would appear as shown below

Now you just need to enter your website domain name/public/install in any browser, as shown below, and an installation wizard would automatically pop up on the screen.

http://yourdomain.com/install

To make the installation process smooth and user friendly, we have come up with a bit more innovative manner of installation where the user would be provided with an installation wizard, user would be required to keep putting the appropriate values in the relevant fields and the installation process would not take more than just a couple of minutes.

After uploading the source code, once we click it, this would open up by default an installation wizard that would look like this,

The above-given slide with Laravel Ecommerce App title is a welcome note to the user. By clicking on the Next button, the wizard would appear like this

The above mentioned are the dependencies or extensions for the server that are essential components for installation. All the green checks would ensure the presence of all the above mentioned dependencies. In case, if the system doesn’t have any of these dependencies already installed, a red cross mark would appear in the corresponding column of the missing component. So make sure to install all the dependencies and extensions to ensure the smooth running and installation of the app.

By clicking the next, the wizard would ask for the permissions as shown below.

You need to grant the directed permissions respectively for instance.

Storage/framework/                                                 775

Storage/logos/                                                             775

Bootstrap/cache/                                                        775

To grant these permissions>

Open your C panel, here you will find three folders in horizontal order named as

App

Framework

Logs

Select the framework and logs folder, right-click on this, and now click on the change permission, enter the relevant vale 775, and click on the change permission on the bottom again.

In the same manner, grant permission to the bootstrap/cache folder by right-clicking on the folder and selecting change permission.

Once all the permissions are granted, all three folders would show a green checkmark on correspondent columns. From here click the next button.

In the next step, you need to complete the environment settings wizard.

By clicking the Wizard Text Editor next slide will show up as given below

Step 1) Give any name to your Website as you like for instance, Laravel 1 or XYZ.

By clicking the true, all the errors would be shown

By clicking the false, no errors would be shown.

Step 4) In Log Type section select debug.

Step 5) In Website URL section, paste your app’s URL and click on the database on the bottom of the wizard.

In the next wizard section, you will be required to enter your database information.

Note: In any case, if you need to change your .env settings or need to change the production or any other mode, you can go to the link below and alter your settings as required. But first complete all the requirements of this wizard.

http://yourdomain/admin/setting

There are three main things interacting when you use Android Studio to create android applications.

· Android SDK, a selection of tools including the Android platform itself

Now you can click on Android Studio to launch it. Once it opens up, you’ll be presented with a menu where you’ll be able to get started or configure some options. The great thing is that everything is handled for you at this point, though you may want to familiarize yourself with the SDK Manager (Configure > SDK Manager) which is where you’ll update your Android SDK to support newer versions, as well as download things like code samples or support for Google Glass. But don’t worry about that now but if Android Studio says you’re missing something, this is where you’ll probably need to go to find it.

4.3) – Open up Project in Android Studio

Locate your Android app in the given project .zip folder and extract it somewhere in your computer.

After every thing is done. your android studio project will look like this. you may ignore the plugin update if it recommends that.

Note: if you want to update your gradle plugin that may need to change some deep source code. It is better to user the same version of plugin.

Note: Your Android Version should be minimum 4.0.0. Updating Android Studio may take few minutes.

Note:For Publishing use this command
keytool -exportcert -alias “aliasName” -keystore “keystoreFilePath” | openssl sha1 -binary | openssl base64M

Note: remember to change the path to you debug.keystore file. and make it sure to use the OpenSSL folder name same as you created in the C drive.

Import App into Android Studio #back to top

After CMS installation, please follow below given instructions to set up your mobile application..

4.1) – Getting Started

Download and install all latest tools, required for developing Android apps such as Java Development Kit and Android Studio as the Official Android IDE. For updated tutorial about how to install them, you can see and Download this from Android Developer website.
Download JDK
Download Android studio IDE

4.2) – Android Studio Setting

There are three main things interacting when you use Android Studio to create android applications.

· The code you write in Java or Kotlin to create interactive android apps
· Android Studio itself, an IDE that provides you with a nice interface for coding
· Android SDK, a selection of tools including the Android platform itself

Now you can click on Android Studio to launch it. Once it opens up, you’ll be presented with a menu where you’ll be able to get started or configure some options. The great thing is that everything is handled for you at this point, though you may want to familiarize yourself with the SDK Manager (Configure > SDK Manager) which is where you’ll update your Android SDK to support newer versions, as well as download things like code samples or support for Google Glass. But don’t worry about that now but if Android Studio says you’re missing something, this is where you’ll probably need to go to find it.

4.3) – Open up Project in Android Studio

Locate your Android app in the given project .zip folder and extract it somewhere in your computer.

Once Android studio ready, click open an existing android studio project.

Browse to directory where you placed the android project and click OK after selecting the root directory of project.

While opening up the project you will get a popup like this. please click OK to building the project.

After this android studio will download some of the packages and execute some gradle plugins into your project.

Note: This may take some time to compile.

While importing your android app you may get some dependencies errors. to resolve that you just need to update versions of libraries or dependencies.

After every thing is done. your android studio project will look like this. you may ignore the plugin update if it recommends that.

Note: if you want to update your gradle plugin that may need to change some deep source code. It is better to user the same version of plugin.

Note: Your Android Version should be minimum 4.0.0. Updating Android Studio may take few minutes.

Project directory structure looks like this. your all java source code is placed under the following package.

we only need ConstantValues.java file to attach our backend.

ConstantValues file looks like this.

Next you need to find the path of debug.keystore file in the C drive usually it is placed in the C:\Users\YOUR_NAME\.android folder.
Now open the Command Prompt. and execute the following command.

Note: For Debugging (use it for development purpose only.)
keytool -exportcert -alias androiddebugkey -keystore “C:\Users\YOUR_NAME\.android\debug.keystore” | “C:\OpenSSL\bin\openssl” sha1 -binary |”C:\OpenSSL\bin\openssl” base64


Note:For Publishing use this command
keytool -exportcert -alias “aliasName” -keystore “keystoreFilePath” | openssl sha1 -binary | openssl base64M

Note: remember to change the path to you debug.keystore file. and make it sure to use the OpenSSL folder name same as you created in the C drive.
when you press enter this will get a password. If you do not create a new password, then default password will be android

Key Hash For Mac

Please follow below mention steps to get hash key for mac OS

First open a terminal (open a command prompt in windows).

Navigate in the terminal to the directory where your Android debug.keystore is stored. Mostly it will located under /Users/user_name/.android/

Once you are in the “.android” directory, run the following command. keytool -exportcert -alias androiddebugkey -keystore debug.keystore | openssl sha1 -binary | openssl base64

When it prompts you for a password, type android and hit Enter

Copy the value printed in the terminal that ends with an = and paste it in the Key Hash field in Facebook. Then click the Save Changes button.

This is your key hash save it to your file and use it in developer Facebook console.
Now paste the application key to the android studio project file shown below as facebook_app_id. (res > values > strings.xml)

Now to get fb_login_protocol_scheme first go to your facebook app settings and in facebook login section select Quickstart and then select android

In the Edit Your Resource and Manifest section you can get fb_login_protocol_scheme. Just copy and save it.

Source Code Setup #back to top

From Where to Begin?

Well, after reaching the above-mentioned step, you need to begin with the website_adminpanel.zip folder. Copy this folder as it is, and paste it in some other dedicated drive and folder and extract the files from the website_adminpanel.zip folder. The extracted files would appear as shown below

Now you just need to enter your website domain name/public/install in any browser, as shown below, and an installation wizard would automatically pop up on the screen.

http://yourdomain.com/install

To make the installation process smooth and user friendly, we have come up with a bit more innovative manner of installation where the user would be provided with an installation wizard, user would be required to keep putting the appropriate values in the relevant fields and the installation process would not take more than just a couple of minutes.

After uploading the source code, once we click it, this would open up by default an installation wizard that would look like this,

The above-given slide with Laravel Ecommerce App title is a welcome note to the user. By clicking on the Next button, the wizard would appear like this

The above mentioned are the dependencies or extensions for the server that are essential components for installation. All the green checks would ensure the presence of all the above mentioned dependencies. In case, if the system doesn’t have any of these dependencies already installed, a red cross mark would appear in the corresponding column of the missing component. So make sure to install all the dependencies and extensions to ensure the smooth running and installation of the app.

By clicking the next, the wizard would ask for the permissions as shown below.

You need to grant the directed permissions respectively for instance.

Storage/framework/                                                 775

Storage/logos/                                                             775

Bootstrap/cache/                                                        775

To grant these permissions>

Open your C panel, here you will find three folders in horizontal order named as

App

Framework

Logs

Select the framework and logs folder, right-click on this, and now click on the change permission, enter the relevant vale 775, and click on the change permission on the bottom again.

In the same manner, grant permission to the bootstrap/cache folder by right-clicking on the folder and selecting change permission.

Once all the permissions are granted, all three folders would show a green checkmark on correspondent columns. From here click the next button.

In the next step, you need to complete the environment settings wizard.

By clicking the Wizard Text Editor next slide will show up as given below

Step 1) Give any name to your Website as you like for instance, Laravel 1 or XYZ.

Step 2) From development mode that carries the following option(s)

By clicking the true, all the errors would be shown

By clicking the false, no errors would be shown.

Step 4) In Log Type section select debug.

Step 5) In Website URL section, paste your app’s URL and click on the database on the bottom of the wizard.

In the next wizard section, you will be required to enter your database information.

Note: In any case, if you need to change your .env settings or need to change the production or any other mode, you can go to the link below and alter your settings as required. But first complete all the requirements of this wizard.

http://yourdomain/admin/setting

To begin with this, you need to create an empty database first in your PHPMyAdmin, enter all of the details of that empty database in the above wizard, and click on the application on the bottom of the wizard.

There are three main things interacting when you use Android Studio to create android applications.

· Android SDK, a selection of tools including the Android platform itself

Now you can click on Android Studio to launch it. Once it opens up, you’ll be presented with a menu where you’ll be able to get started or configure some options. The great thing is that everything is handled for you at this point, though you may want to familiarize yourself with the SDK Manager (Configure > SDK Manager) which is where you’ll update your Android SDK to support newer versions, as well as download things like code samples or support for Google Glass. But don’t worry about that now but if Android Studio says you’re missing something, this is where you’ll probably need to go to find it.

From Where to Begin?

Well, after reaching the above-mentioned step, you need to begin with the website_adminpanel.zip folder. Copy this folder as it is, and paste it in some other dedicated drive and folder and extract the files from the website_adminpanel.zip folder. The extracted files would appear as shown below

http://yourdomain.com/install

To make the installation process smooth and user friendly, we have come up with a bit more innovative manner of installation where the user would be provided with an installation wizard, user would be required to keep putting the appropriate values in the relevant fields and the installation process would not take more than just a couple of minutes.

After uploading the source code, once we click it, this would open up by default an installation wizard that would look like this,

The above-given slide with Laravel Ecommerce App title is a welcome note to the user. By clicking on the Next button, the wizard would appear like this

The above mentioned are the dependencies or extensions for the server that are essential components for installation. All the green checks would ensure the presence of all the above mentioned dependencies. In case, if the system doesn’t have any of these dependencies already installed, a red cross mark would appear in the corresponding column of the missing component. So make sure to install all the dependencies and extensions to ensure the smooth running and installation of the app.

Import App into Android Studio #back to top

After CMS installation, please follow below given instructions to set up your mobile application..

4.1) – Getting Started

Download and install all latest tools, required for developing Android apps such as Java Development Kit and Android Studio as the Official Android IDE. For updated tutorial about how to install them, you can see and Download this from Android Developer website.
Download JDK
Download Android studio IDE

4.2) – Android Studio Setting

There are three main things interacting when you use Android Studio to create android applications.

· The code you write in Java or Kotlin to create interactive android apps
· Android Studio itself, an IDE that provides you with a nice interface for coding
· Android SDK, a selection of tools including the Android platform itself

Now you can click on Android Studio to launch it. Once it opens up, you’ll be presented with a menu where you’ll be able to get started or configure some options. The great thing is that everything is handled for you at this point, though you may want to familiarize yourself with the SDK Manager (Configure > SDK Manager) which is where you’ll update your Android SDK to support newer versions, as well as download things like code samples or support for Google Glass. But don’t worry about that now but if Android Studio says you’re missing something, this is where you’ll probably need to go to find it.

4.3) – Open up Project in Android Studio

Locate your Android app in the given project .zip folder and extract it somewhere in your computer.

Once Android studio ready, click open an existing android studio project.

Browse to directory where you placed the android project and click OK after selecting the root directory of project.

While opening up the project you will get a popup like this. please click OK to building the project.

After this android studio will download some of the packages and execute some gradle plugins into your project.

Note: This may take some time to compile.

While importing your android app you may get some dependencies errors. to resolve that you just need to update versions of libraries or dependencies.

After every thing is done. your android studio project will look like this. you may ignore the plugin update if it recommends that.

Note: if you want to update your gradle plugin that may need to change some deep source code. It is better to user the same version of plugin.

Note: Your Android Version should be minimum 4.0.0. Updating Android Studio may take few minutes.

Project directory structure looks like this. your all java source code is placed under the following package.

we only need ConstantValues.java file to attach our backend.

Now open the Command Prompt. and execute the following command.

Note: For Debugging (use it for development purpose only.)
keytool -exportcert -alias androiddebugkey -keystore “C:\Users\YOUR_NAME\.android\debug.keystore” | “C:\OpenSSL\bin\openssl” sha1 -binary |”C:\OpenSSL\bin\openssl” base64


Note:For Publishing use this command
keytool -exportcert -alias “aliasName” -keystore “keystoreFilePath” | openssl sha1 -binary | openssl base64M

Note: remember to change the path to you debug.keystore file. and make it sure to use the OpenSSL folder name same as you created in the C drive.
when you press enter this will get a password. If you do not create a new password, then default password will be android

Key Hash For Mac

When it prompts you for a password, type android and hit Enter

Copy the value printed in the terminal that ends with an = and paste it in the Key Hash field in Facebook. Then click the Save Changes button.

This is your key hash save it to your file and use it in developer Facebook console.

Source Code Setup #back to top

From Where to Begin?

Well, after reaching the above-mentioned step, you need to begin with the website_adminpanel.zip folder. Copy this folder as it is, and paste it in some other dedicated drive and folder and extract the files from the website_adminpanel.zip folder. The extracted files would appear as shown below

Now you just need to enter your website domain name/public/install in any browser, as shown below, and an installation wizard would automatically pop up on the screen.

http://yourdomain.com/install

To make the installation process smooth and user friendly, we have come up with a bit more innovative manner of installation where the user would be provided with an installation wizard, user would be required to keep putting the appropriate values in the relevant fields and the installation process would not take more than just a couple of minutes.

After uploading the source code, once we click it, this would open up by default an installation wizard that would look like this,

The above-given slide with Laravel Ecommerce App title is a welcome note to the user. By clicking on the Next button, the wizard would appear like this

The above mentioned are the dependencies or extensions for the server that are essential components for installation. All the green checks would ensure the presence of all the above mentioned dependencies. In case, if the system doesn’t have any of these dependencies already installed, a red cross mark would appear in the corresponding column of the missing component. So make sure to install all the dependencies and extensions to ensure the smooth running and installation of the app.

By clicking the next, the wizard would ask for the permissions as shown below.

You need to grant the directed permissions respectively for instance.

Storage/framework/                                                 775

Storage/logos/                                                             775

Bootstrap/cache/                                                        775

To grant these permissions>

Open your C panel, here you will find three folders in horizontal order named as

App

Framework

Logs

Select the framework and logs folder, right-click on this, and now click on the change permission, enter the relevant vale 775, and click on the change permission on the bottom again.

In the same manner, grant permission to the bootstrap/cache folder by right-clicking on the folder and selecting change permission.

Once all the permissions are granted, all three folders would show a green checkmark on correspondent columns. From here click the next button.

In the next step, you need to complete the environment settings wizard.

By clicking the Wizard Text Editor next slide will show up as given below

Step 1) Give any name to your Website as you like for instance, Laravel 1 or XYZ.

Step 2) From development mode that carries the following option(s)

By clicking the true, all the errors would be shown

By clicking the false, no errors would be shown.

Step 4) In Log Type section select debug.

Step 5) In Website URL section, paste your app’s URL and click on the database on the bottom of the wizard.

In the next wizard section, you will be required to enter your database information.

Note: In any case, if you need to change your .env settings or need to change the production or any other mode, you can go to the link below and alter your settings as required. But first complete all the requirements of this wizard.

http://yourdomain/admin/setting

To begin with this, you need to create an empty database first in your PHPMyAdmin, enter all of the details of that empty database in the above wizard, and click on the application on the bottom of the wizard.

4.2) – Android Studio Setting

There are three main things interacting when you use Android Studio to create android applications.

· The code you write in Java or Kotlin to create interactive android apps
· Android Studio itself, an IDE that provides you with a nice interface for coding
· Android SDK, a selection of tools including the Android platform itself

Now you can click on Android Studio to launch it. Once it opens up, you’ll be presented with a menu where you’ll be able to get started or configure some options. The great thing is that everything is handled for you at this point, though you may want to familiarize yourself with the SDK Manager (Configure > SDK Manager) which is where you’ll update your Android SDK to support newer versions, as well as download things like code samples or support for Google Glass. But don’t worry about that now but if Android Studio says you’re missing something, this is where you’ll probably need to go to find it.

4.3) – Open up Project in Android Studio

Locate your Android app in the given project .zip folder and extract it somewhere in your computer.

Source Code Setup #back to top

From Where to Begin?

Well, after reaching the above-mentioned step, you need to begin with the website_adminpanel.zip folder. Copy this folder as it is, and paste it in some other dedicated drive and folder and extract the files from the website_adminpanel.zip folder. The extracted files would appear as shown below

Now you just need to enter your website domain name/public/install in any browser, as shown below, and an installation wizard would automatically pop up on the screen.

http://yourdomain.com/install

To make the installation process smooth and user friendly, we have come up with a bit more innovative manner of installation where the user would be provided with an installation wizard, user would be required to keep putting the appropriate values in the relevant fields and the installation process would not take more than just a couple of minutes.

After uploading the source code, once we click it, this would open up by default an installation wizard that would look like this,

The above-given slide with Laravel Ecommerce App title is a welcome note to the user. By clicking on the Next button, the wizard would appear like this

The above mentioned are the dependencies or extensions for the server that are essential components for installation. All the green checks would ensure the presence of all the above mentioned dependencies. In case, if the system doesn’t have any of these dependencies already installed, a red cross mark would appear in the corresponding column of the missing component. So make sure to install all the dependencies and extensions to ensure the smooth running and installation of the app.

By clicking the next, the wizard would ask for the permissions as shown below.

You need to grant the directed permissions respectively for instance.

Storage/framework/                                                 775

Storage/logos/                                                             775

Bootstrap/cache/                                                        775

To grant these permissions>

Open your C panel, here you will find three folders in horizontal order named as

App

Framework

Logs

Select the framework and logs folder, right-click on this, and now click on the change permission, enter the relevant vale 775, and click on the change permission on the bottom again.

In the same manner, grant permission to the bootstrap/cache folder by right-clicking on the folder and selecting change permission.

Once all the permissions are granted, all three folders would show a green checkmark on correspondent columns. From here click the next button.

Source Code Setup #back to top

From Where to Begin?

Well, after reaching the above-mentioned step, you need to begin with the website_adminpanel.zip folder. Copy this folder as it is, and paste it in some other dedicated drive and folder and extract the files from the website_adminpanel.zip folder. The extracted files would appear as shown below

Now you just need to enter your website domain name/public/install in any browser, as shown below, and an installation wizard would automatically pop up on the screen.

http://yourdomain.com/install

To make the installation process smooth and user friendly, we have come up with a bit more innovative manner of installation where the user would be provided with an installation wizard, user would be required to keep putting the appropriate values in the relevant fields and the installation process would not take more than just a couple of minutes.

After uploading the source code, once we click it, this would open up by default an installation wizard that would look like this,

The above-given slide with Laravel Ecommerce App title is a welcome note to the user. By clicking on the Next button, the wizard would appear like this

The above mentioned are the dependencies or extensions for the server that are essential components for installation. All the green checks would ensure the presence of all the above mentioned dependencies. In case, if the system doesn’t have any of these dependencies already installed, a red cross mark would appear in the corresponding column of the missing component. So make sure to install all the dependencies and extensions to ensure the smooth running and installation of the app.

By clicking the next, the wizard would ask for the permissions as shown below.

You need to grant the directed permissions respectively for instance.

Storage/framework/                                                 775

Storage/logos/                                                             775

Bootstrap/cache/                                                        775

To grant these permissions>

Open your C panel, here you will find three folders in horizontal order named as

App

Framework

Logs

Select the framework and logs folder, right-click on this, and now click on the change permission, enter the relevant vale 775, and click on the change permission on the bottom again.

In the same manner, grant permission to the bootstrap/cache folder by right-clicking on the folder and selecting change permission.

Once all the permissions are granted, all three folders would show a green checkmark on correspondent columns. From here click the next button.

In the next step, you need to complete the environment settings wizard.

By clicking the Wizard Text Editor next slide will show up as given below

Step 1) Give any name to your Website as you like for instance, Laravel 1 or XYZ.

By clicking the false, no errors would be shown.

Step 4) In Log Type section select debug.

Step 5) In Website URL section, paste your app’s URL and click on the database on the bottom of the wizard.

In the next wizard section, you will be required to enter your database information.

Note: In any case, if you need to change your .env settings or need to change the production or any other mode, you can go to the link below and alter your settings as required. But first complete all the requirements of this wizard.

4.2) – Android Studio Setting

There are three main things interacting when you use Android Studio to create android applications.

· The code you write in Java or Kotlin to create interactive android apps
· Android Studio itself, an IDE that provides you with a nice interface for coding
· Android SDK, a selection of tools including the Android platform itself

Now you can click on Android Studio to launch it. Once it opens up, you’ll be presented with a menu where you’ll be able to get started or configure some options. The great thing is that everything is handled for you at this point, though you may want to familiarize yourself with the SDK Manager (Configure > SDK Manager) which is where you’ll update your Android SDK to support newer versions, as well as download things like code samples or support for Google Glass. But don’t worry about that now but if Android Studio says you’re missing something, this is where you’ll probably need to go to find it.

4.3) – Open up Project in Android Studio

Locate your Android app in the given project .zip folder and extract it somewhere in your computer.

Once Android studio ready, click open an existing android studio project.

From Where to Begin?

Well, after reaching the above-mentioned step, you need to begin with the website_adminpanel.zip folder. Copy this folder as it is, and paste it in some other dedicated drive and folder and extract the files from the website_adminpanel.zip folder. The extracted files would appear as shown below

To make the installation process smooth and user friendly, we have come up with a bit more innovative manner of installation where the user would be provided with an installation wizard, user would be required to keep putting the appropriate values in the relevant fields and the installation process would not take more than just a couple of minutes.

After uploading the source code, once we click it, this would open up by default an installation wizard that would look like this,

The above-given slide with Laravel Ecommerce App title is a welcome note to the user. By clicking on the Next button, the wizard would appear like this

The above mentioned are the dependencies or extensions for the server that are essential components for installation. All the green checks would ensure the presence of all the above mentioned dependencies. In case, if the system doesn’t have any of these dependencies already installed, a red cross mark would appear in the corresponding column of the missing component. So make sure to install all the dependencies and extensions to ensure the smooth running and installation of the app.

By clicking the next, the wizard would ask for the permissions as shown below.

You need to grant the directed permissions respectively for instance.

There are three main things interacting when you use Android Studio to create android applications.

Now you can click on Android Studio to launch it. Once it opens up, you’ll be presented with a menu where you’ll be able to get started or configure some options. The great thing is that everything is handled for you at this point, though you may want to familiarize yourself with the SDK Manager (Configure > SDK Manager) which is where you’ll update your Android SDK to support newer versions, as well as download things like code samples or support for Google Glass. But don’t worry about that now but if Android Studio says you’re missing something, this is where you’ll probably need to go to find it.

Note: if you want to update your gradle plugin that may need to change some deep source code. It is better to user the same version of plugin.

Note: Your Android Version should be minimum 4.0.0. Updating Android Studio may take few minutes.

Source Code Setup #back to top

From Where to Begin?

Well, after reaching the above-mentioned step, you need to begin with the website_adminpanel.zip folder. Copy this folder as it is, and paste it in some other dedicated drive and folder and extract the files from the website_adminpanel.zip folder. The extracted files would appear as shown below

Now you just need to enter your website domain name/public/install in any browser, as shown below, and an installation wizard would automatically pop up on the screen.

http://yourdomain.com/install

To make the installation process smooth and user friendly, we have come up with a bit more innovative manner of installation where the user would be provided with an installation wizard, user would be required to keep putting the appropriate values in the relevant fields and the installation process would not take more than just a couple of minutes.

After uploading the source code, once we click it, this would open up by default an installation wizard that would look like this,

The above-given slide with Laravel Ecommerce App title is a welcome note to the user. By clicking on the Next button, the wizard would appear like this

The above mentioned are the dependencies or extensions for the server that are essential components for installation. All the green checks would ensure the presence of all the above mentioned dependencies. In case, if the system doesn’t have any of these dependencies already installed, a red cross mark would appear in the corresponding column of the missing component. So make sure to install all the dependencies and extensions to ensure the smooth running and installation of the app.

By clicking the next, the wizard would ask for the permissions as shown below.

You need to grant the directed permissions respectively for instance.

Storage/framework/                                                 775

Storage/logos/                                                             775

Bootstrap/cache/                                                        775

To grant these permissions>

Open your C panel, here you will find three folders in horizontal order named as

App

Framework

Logs

Select the framework and logs folder, right-click on this, and now click on the change permission, enter the relevant vale 775, and click on the change permission on the bottom again.

In the same manner, grant permission to the bootstrap/cache folder by right-clicking on the folder and selecting change permission.

Once all the permissions are granted, all three folders would show a green checkmark on correspondent columns. From here click the next button.

In the next step, you need to complete the environment settings wizard.

By clicking the Wizard Text Editor next slide will show up as given below

Step 1) Give any name to your Website as you like for instance, Laravel 1 or XYZ.

By clicking the true, all the errors would be shown

By clicking the false, no errors would be shown.

Step 4) In Log Type section select debug.

Step 5) In Website URL section, paste your app’s URL and click on the database on the bottom of the wizard.

In the next wizard section, you will be required to enter your database information.

Note: In any case, if you need to change your .env settings or need to change the production or any other mode, you can go to the link below and alter your settings as required. But first complete all the requirements of this wizard.

After CMS installation, please follow below given instructions to set up your mobile application..

4.1) – Getting Started

Download and install all latest tools, required for developing Android apps such as Java Development Kit and Android Studio as the Official Android IDE. For updated tutorial about how to install them, you can see and Download this from Android Developer website.
Download JDK
Download Android studio IDE

4.2) – Android Studio Setting

There are three main things interacting when you use Android Studio to create android applications.

· The code you write in Java or Kotlin to create interactive android apps
· Android Studio itself, an IDE that provides you with a nice interface for coding
· Android SDK, a selection of tools including the Android platform itself

Now you can click on Android Studio to launch it. Once it opens up, you’ll be presented with a menu where you’ll be able to get started or configure some options. The great thing is that everything is handled for you at this point, though you may want to familiarize yourself with the SDK Manager (Configure > SDK Manager) which is where you’ll update your Android SDK to support newer versions, as well as download things like code samples or support for Google Glass. But don’t worry about that now but if Android Studio says you’re missing something, this is where you’ll probably need to go to find it.

4.3) – Open up Project in Android Studio

Locate your Android app in the given project .zip folder and extract it somewhere in your computer.

Once Android studio ready, click open an existing android studio project.

Browse to directory where you placed the android project and click OK after selecting the root directory of project.

While opening up the project you will get a popup like this. please click OK to building the project.

After this android studio will download some of the packages and execute some gradle plugins into your project.

Note: This may take some time to compile.

While importing your android app you may get some dependencies errors. to resolve that you just need to update versions of libraries or dependencies.

After every thing is done. your android studio project will look like this. you may ignore the plugin update if it recommends that.

Note: if you want to update your gradle plugin that may need to change some deep source code. It is better to user the same version of plugin.

Note: Your Android Version should be minimum 4.0.0. Updating Android Studio may take few minutes.

Project directory structure looks like this. your all java source code is placed under the following package.

we only need ConstantValues.java file to attach our backend.

Now open the Command Prompt. and execute the following command.

Note: For Debugging (use it for development purpose only.)
keytool -exportcert -alias androiddebugkey -keystore “C:\Users\YOUR_NAME\.android\debug.keystore” | “C:\OpenSSL\bin\openssl” sha1 -binary |”C:\OpenSSL\bin\openssl” base64


Note:For Publishing use this command
keytool -exportcert -alias “aliasName” -keystore “keystoreFilePath” | openssl sha1 -binary | openssl base64M

Note: remember to change the path to you debug.keystore file. and make it sure to use the OpenSSL folder name same as you created in the C drive.
when you press enter this will get a password. If you do not create a new password, then default password will be android

Key Hash For Mac

Please follow below mention steps to get hash key for mac OS

First open a terminal (open a command prompt in windows).

When it prompts you for a password, type android and hit Enter

Copy the value printed in the terminal that ends with an = and paste it in the Key Hash field in Facebook. Then click the Save Changes button.

This is your key hash save it to your file and use it in developer Facebook console.

Source Code Setup #back to top

From Where to Begin?

Well, after reaching the above-mentioned step, you need to begin with the website_adminpanel.zip folder. Copy this folder as it is, and paste it in some other dedicated drive and folder and extract the files from the website_adminpanel.zip folder. The extracted files would appear as shown below

Now you just need to enter your website domain name/public/install in any browser, as shown below, and an installation wizard would automatically pop up on the screen.

http://yourdomain.com/install

To make the installation process smooth and user friendly, we have come up with a bit more innovative manner of installation where the user would be provided with an installation wizard, user would be required to keep putting the appropriate values in the relevant fields and the installation process would not take more than just a couple of minutes.

After uploading the source code, once we click it, this would open up by default an installation wizard that would look like this,

The above-given slide with Laravel Ecommerce App title is a welcome note to the user. By clicking on the Next button, the wizard would appear like this

The above mentioned are the dependencies or extensions for the server that are essential components for installation. All the green checks would ensure the presence of all the above mentioned dependencies. In case, if the system doesn’t have any of these dependencies already installed, a red cross mark would appear in the corresponding column of the missing component. So make sure to install all the dependencies and extensions to ensure the smooth running and installation of the app.

By clicking the next, the wizard would ask for the permissions as shown below.

You need to grant the directed permissions respectively for instance.

Storage/framework/                                                 775

Storage/logos/                                                             775

Bootstrap/cache/                                                        775

To grant these permissions>

Open your C panel, here you will find three folders in horizontal order named as

App

Framework

Logs

Select the framework and logs folder, right-click on this, and now click on the change permission, enter the relevant vale 775, and click on the change permission on the bottom again.

In the same manner, grant permission to the bootstrap/cache folder by right-clicking on the folder and selecting change permission.

Once all the permissions are granted, all three folders would show a green checkmark on correspondent columns. From here click the next button.

In the next step, you need to complete the environment settings wizard.

By clicking the Wizard Text Editor next slide will show up as given below

Step 1) Give any name to your Website as you like for instance, Laravel 1 or XYZ.

Step 2) From development mode that carries the following option(s)

By clicking the true, all the errors would be shown

By clicking the false, no errors would be shown.

Step 4) In Log Type section select debug.

Step 5) In Website URL section, paste your app’s URL and click on the database on the bottom of the wizard.

In the next wizard section, you will be required to enter your database information.

Note: In any case, if you need to change your .env settings or need to change the production or any other mode, you can go to the link below and alter your settings as required. But first complete all the requirements of this wizard.

http://yourdomain/admin/setting

To begin with this, you need to create an empty database first in your PHPMyAdmin, enter all of the details of that empty database in the above wizard, and click on the application on the bottom of the wizard.

4.2) – Android Studio Setting

There are three main things interacting when you use Android Studio to create android applications.

· The code you write in Java or Kotlin to create interactive android apps

· Android SDK, a selection of tools including the Android platform itself

Now you can click on Android Studio to launch it. Once it opens up, you’ll be presented with a menu where you’ll be able to get started or configure some options. The great thing is that everything is handled for you at this point, though you may want to familiarize yourself with the SDK Manager (Configure > SDK Manager) which is where you’ll update your Android SDK to support newer versions, as well as download things like code samples or support for Google Glass. But don’t worry about that now but if Android Studio says you’re missing something, this is where you’ll probably need to go to find it.

4.3) – Open up Project in Android Studio

After every thing is done. your android studio project will look like this. you may ignore the plugin update if it recommends that.

Note: if you want to update your gradle plugin that may need to change some deep source code. It is better to user the same version of plugin.

Note: Your Android Version should be minimum 4.0.0. Updating Android Studio may take few minutes.

keytool -exportcert -alias androiddebugkey -keystore “C:\Users\YOUR_NAME\.android\debug.keystore” | “C:\OpenSSL\bin\openssl” sha1 -binary |”C:\OpenSSL\bin\openssl” base64


Note:For Publishing use this command
keytool -exportcert -alias “aliasName” -keystore “keystoreFilePath” | openssl sha1 -binary | openssl base64M

Note: remember to change the path to you debug.keystore file. and make it sure to use the OpenSSL folder name same as you created in the C drive.
